# T3_CleanCodeStudy
An ongoing community-aided learning project involving TicTacToe[T3] and the art of clean coding.
[Last edit: 3/24/2016]

The aim of this repo is mainly to learn the principles of clean, maintainable coding in the context of
TicTacToe.

Why TicTacToe?
Admittedly, because IMO it's complex enough to require a fair amount of thought [at least for me] but simple enough to be able to use it to grasp the concepts and not have them be lost in the context of a larger-scale project whose code base is no less than 10x larger than this ever will be.

With that said, it will [ideally] evolve over time not just in clarity and smoothness of the code itself but also in functionality (i.e. as of today it exists only as a terminal app in Java but I'd like to span that over multiple languages as deployed, professional [looking] web apps).

In the spirit of accomplishing this to the fullest extent, everything (yes, everything) is subject to review/critique. That means:
-The code itself(obviously)
-The structure of the program, including the file/directory relationships
-functionality
-anything else I can't think of (but it DOES still have to be relevant - no trolling for the sake of. Constructive trolling is fine. ;) )

It will also start out sans too many user stories, so as not to color the code (and therefore test its initial readability). Just assume it is at least a complete, 3x3 game.

So have at it - I promise I won't cry if my code is bunk - and skimp not on details. I'm a sucker for details.
